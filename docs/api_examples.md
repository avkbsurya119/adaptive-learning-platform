# API Examples (Future Extension)

This file is reserved for a future FastAPI or web-based interface.

Potential endpoints:

- `GET /search?q=...`
- `GET /courses`
- `GET /courses/{course_id}/prereqs`
- `POST /students`
- `GET /students/{id}/recommendations`

The CLI currently demonstrates all core flows.
